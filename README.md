# Plate-heat-exchanger

The objective of this project was to build a compact, cost effective and thermally efficient heat exchanger. Cross flow plate heat exchanger was chosen due to its compact alignment, high Surface area to volume ratio and good efficiency. Chevron designed incorporated into the plate to create a turbulent reign in order to increase the convective heat transfer.
Topology was shared and hot and cold fluid volume were created. The model was meshed using hex8 elements and boundary conditions of inlet temperature of hot 80 C and cold 30 C fluid were given. 
An iterative process of heat exchanger for 8,10 and 12 plates with Cu, Al and SS were carried out. The outlet temperature was noted and thermal efficiency of the heat exchanger were noted in each case using formula (T_hot_inlet-T_cold_inlet)/( T_hot_outlet-T_cold_outlet).
Optimisation was carried out among number of plates, thermal efficiency and cost with bias 0.2,0.4, and 0.4 and engineered chevron-grooved aluminium heat exchanger(10-plate) achieving 62% thermal effectiveness.
